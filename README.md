  Windows 10 decrapifier Version 2:
  This was downloaded from the windows decrapifier group on spice works (see address below). These guys are awesome and produce some        really solid code that is awesome for removing all of the bloatware from Windows 10.  
      THIS SHOULD ONLY BE USED ON A FRESH INSTALL!!!! Using this on an existing install of WINDOWS 10 may remove the apps that were user  installed and cause system instability so watch out!!!!. ALSO I CLAIM NO OWNERSHIP OF THIS CODE!!! THIS IS ONLY ON GITHUB SO I CAN SYNC REMOTELY
